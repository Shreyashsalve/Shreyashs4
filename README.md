Attendance Management System using Face Recognition

This project automates the attendance tracking process using facial recognition technology. It captures images of individuals via a webcam, compares them to a pre-trained database, and records attendance when a match is found. The system also allows for manual attendance entry and stores data in a CSV file for easy access. This solution provides an efficient, accurate, and scalable method for tracking attendance in educational institutions and workplaces.
